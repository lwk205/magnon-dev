# magnon-dev
The magnon code is developed to calculate dynamic spin susceptibility based on time-dependent density functional perturbation theory. It is built on top of Phonon code of Quantum Espresso (QE), partly by direcly copying/modifying subroutines from QE. A proper resconstruction and documentation of the code is still on the way.
